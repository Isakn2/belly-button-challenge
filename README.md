# belly-button-challenge

This repository includes the script to show an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
The files are:
	samples.json (dataset)
	README.md (this file)
	index.html (deliverable dashboard)
	static/js/app.js (javascript to run on index file.)
